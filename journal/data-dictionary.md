| otherPoints          | Collider array | 24     | Local to RoamHelper but is accessed by trap scripts and the wumpus script | The array that takes in the values returned by the overlap sphere (Overlap Spheres return an array of colliders). Is accessed later to produce random points for spawning and roaming                                                                                      |
| isGrounded           | Boolean        | 1      | Local to Movement2                                                        | The condition for jumping and determining if force should be added upwards or not                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| moveDirection        | Vector3        | 3      | Local to Movement2                                                        | The vector for the direction of movement. Allows the player to move relative to its own rotation rather than relative to the world because it takes its data from the transform of the player.                                                                             |

It is a transform rather than a Vector3 position because the transform contains the rotation, position, and scale of the object, meaning it will always shoot forward from the player rather than forward in the world (Z+) |
| navAgent             | NavMesh Agent  | 1      | Local to WumpusStates                                                     | Contains the navmesh agent component of the wumpus game object. This allowed for an easy way to implement pathfinding using Unity's navmesh system.                                                                                                                        |
