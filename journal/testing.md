# Testing

### Testing by myself

During the development of my game I had to test many of my mechanics before moving onto the next one. I usually did this by first checking the error returned and then performing the next action accordingly, e.g. if it was a compiler error, I would go and check the code and the inspector. However many times it was not a compiler error, but a logic error. These errors required much more thinking about how to solve, and often required the `Debug.Log()` function to see what was in the variables to help me solve the problem, and sometimes required the reworking of entire scripts.

### Testing with others

When my game was nearing the end of development, I exported it and sent it to a few friends, asking them to test it. They played it and told me about the bugs that they encountered. A big problem was UI, especially the scaling of it on higher resolution monitors. I normally use the resolution 1280x720, so for this game, I calibrated the UI to fit with 1920x1080 resolutions. Similarly with mouse sensitivity, a lot of people said the sensitivity was really high. I usually use DPI 500, and was surprised to learn that a lot of people use very high DPIs of 1000-2000. After learning this, I calibrated the mouse sensitivity to fit with a DPI of 1000 by default.
