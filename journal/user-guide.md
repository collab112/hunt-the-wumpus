**<u>What to do?</u>**

**You are a lost person in a dense hedge maze. You can sense something around you.. you aren't alone, you know that. You pick up a few rocks to defend yourself against the horrifying wumpus that lurks.**

You spawn in a random place on the map, and so does the Wumpus. Your objective is to hunt down the Wumpus and escape the maze!

**Kill the Wumpus to win!** They take 2 hits to kill.

**The wumpus cannot jump!** Jump over obstacles to get away if they have you in their sights!

**Beware of the traps!** There are traps scattered around the map that will alert the Wumpus to your location or kill you!

**You don't have infinite rocks!** Don't miss! If you run out, the Wumpus will realise this and chase you down!

Pictures of the Wumpus are attached below. Watch out for them!
