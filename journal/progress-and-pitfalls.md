# Progress & Pitfalls

My idea for the game was a casual, replayable, simple game.  

When I first started the game, I had not had too much experience with Unity and it had been a while since I last used Unity. I thought of ways to turn the game into a 3D game, and decided to turn it into a sort of FPS game in a big map. 

Similarly to Yob taking inspiration from other games, I too took inspiration from the  other game *Dead By Daylight* in the mechanic where the Wumpus cannot jump over the obstacles and the player can, offering a way to get away from the Wumpus if need be. 

My first major hindrance was the mouse movement system. The way I had implemented it was not ideal and had to be reworked. I got it all fixed quite quickly however, and started implementing more mechanics. 

I wanted to have traps in my game, similar to Yob's, so I used two types of traps - a trapdoor, and a noise trap where the Wumpus will check if triggered. With my environment being a natural, forest setting, I made the noise trap play the sound of a hawk. 

I tested it for a bit, and the gameplay was pretty fun. But it was pretty easy, so I turned the Wumpus' speed up a bit to make it a bit more challenging.

The player, wumpus and traps are all spawned randomly at the start of the game on the map. Making this particular map however proved to be quite tedious. I started with some cubes, and adjusted the dimensions to make big defining walls that shape the map. 

The UI was the hardest part to accomplish, as the Unity UI system is not very intuitive and very finicky to use.
