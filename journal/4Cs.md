# 4 Cs of 21<sup>st</sup> Century Learning

### Creative

I used creative thinking when creating various assets from the game. The wumpus model was designed by me and I took inspiration from the Minecraft ghast. The winning music was also from me.  

### Critical thinking

Many times when I was writing and testing scripts, I found there was some bugs in the code. At first I would mess around in the Unity inspector and scene view, trying to fix it. However, after fruitless efforts I decided to take a new approach, logging specific variables to the console to try and find out exactly what was going wrong. This gave me a much better understanding of what was happening and why, and helped me understand how to really use Unity.

### Collaboration

I got my polygon trees asset from Julian, and the pause script was from a previous project that Aavin, Julian and I worked on.

### Communication

I asked many questions to many friends about why my code wasn't working and how to implement certain mechanics. I also used classtime to discuss certain mechanics of the game with others, and compare other people's projects.
