# Justification of choice of tier

I chose Tier 2 (Unity). I chose this because I had used Unity a bit before, and I felt Python would be too messy with all the imported libraries, while Unity by itself has all the libraries already, and I had been wanting to get into Unity for a while. I also decided it would be easier to implement things such as pathfinding, since Unity has a navmesh system in it already. I also thought it would be a good learning experience for me in the field of coding and usage of the Unity Game Engine in general.

I would be more proud of the end product using Unity, as it would be my first finished 3D game. 

I chose Unity over Godot or Unreal engine for various reasons. The main one was that Unity is very popular, so finding documentation, assets and tutorials for it would be very easy.
